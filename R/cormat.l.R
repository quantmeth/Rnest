#' A list containing 120 lists of correlation matrices and their underlying characteristics
#'
#' A list containing 120 lists of \eqn{24 \times 24} correlation matrices 
#' (R) built to represent different factor structures.
#' Different levels of loadings (delta, .4, .5, .6, .7, .8), 
#' correlation between factors (corrfact, .0, .1, .2 .3), and.
#' number of factors (nfactors, 1:8) are used. The list contained 
#' matrice (R), and their underlying characteristics (delta, corrfact, 
#' and nfactors).
